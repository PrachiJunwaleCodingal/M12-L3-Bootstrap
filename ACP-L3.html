        <h3>1. Hiking</h3>
        <p>One of the best possible activities, hiking combines cardio fitness with beautiful views and quiet time to
            yourself. You
            can find a good place to hike almost anywhere, and it’s the perfect way to get away from all the stress of
            your daily
            life.

        <h3>Camping</h3>
        <p>If you want to be outside, but for whatever reason, long-distance treks aren’t quite your thing, try some
            simple
            camping. From your backyard to the campground in your local state park, there’s always a good place to camp.
